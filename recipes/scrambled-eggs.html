    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a modification from Gordon Ramsay's delicious scrambled eggs approach.It is a quick breakfast option that won't take up too much time, around 15-20 minutes.<br>The trick is keep scrambling the eggs on lowish heat, this results in a lovely texture. I personally pair them with 2 toasted slices with avocado and honey for a filling breakfast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs.</li>
        <li>15g of butter.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter on pan or skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat a bit and add the eggs.</li>
        <li>Add salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Keep those eggs moving until they begin to set.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat before they reach the desired hardness, they will keep cooking for a bit.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
